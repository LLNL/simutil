/** Implements a "scratch heap" memory pool.  The idea behind this pool
 *  is to provide a relatively large area of memory that is available
 *  for transient calculations that persist only within a given scope.
 *  Such memory could be obtained from malloc, but this can lead to
 *  memory fragmentation especially when the amount of memory needed
 *  isn't known in advance and realloc must be called to grow an array
 *  initially allocated too small.
 *
 *  A pointer to the heap is always in one of two states: open or
 *  closed.  The heapGet function returns a pointer to an open block.
 *  An open block is allowed to access memory through the end of the
 *  scratch heap.  The heapEndBlock function converts an open block to a
 *  closed block.  Closed blocks are expected to access only memory
 *  within the size limit passed to heapEndBlock.
 *
 *  heapGet returns a pointer either to the start of the heap (if there
 *  are no closed block) or to the next valid address after the end of
 *  the last closed block.  Modules can request multiple consecutive
 *  blocks of memory within the scratch heap by repeatedly calling
 *  heapGet followed by heapEndBlock.
 *
 *  Clearly all sorts of problems will occur if any module attempts to
 *  use more memory than the scratch heap provides or if two modules
 *  attempt to use the same memory areas within the sratch heap.  To
 *  help detect such problems this implementation will enforce the
 *  following requirements:
 *
 *  1.  Only a single block can be "open" at any time.
 *  2.  heapEndBlock cannot request more space than is available in
 *      scratch heap (excluding any existing closed blocks).
 *  3.  heapFree can be called only on "closed" blocks.
 *  4.  Every call to heapGet must have a matching call to heapFree.
 *  5.  Calls to heapFree  must occur in reverse sequence of the
 *      heapGet calls.  I.e, heapFree can only be called for
 *      closed block at the end of the scratch heap. 
 *
 *
 *  Taken together, these three requirements impose the following
 *  required conventions for callers:
 *
 *  1.  heapEndBlock *must* be called for every block.  The call may be
 *      deferred until the caller knows how much space is needed, but
 *      heapEndBlock must be called even if it is immediately before
 *      heapFree.
 *  2.  Callers must call heapFree on each block they request.
 *  3.  Calls to heapGet and heapFree must nest properly at all
 *      levels of the application.  This is intended to enforce the
 *      idea that the scratch heap is temporary storage that must be
 *      released when a module goes out of scope.  It will also prevent
 *      fragmentation of the heap.

// Questions / ToDo:
// 1.  Should the verbose keyword instead take a string that would
//     be interprested as a regular expression that would match
//     task numbers?  How can we use task numbers without introducing
//     MPI into this module?
// 2.  How concerned should we be about the fact that basename isn't
//     re-entrant?
// 3.  Code for verbose tracking isn't written
// 4.  Error messages don't report task number.
// 5.  Better way to die than MPI_Abort
// 6.  heapAlreadyAllocatedWarning doesn't do anything.
